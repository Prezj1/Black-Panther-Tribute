            <p>King T'Challa is the ruling monarch of Wakanda and the current Black Panther, both mantles that were passed down to him after the tragic passing away of his father during the attack of the United Nations Summit by Helmut Zemo.</p>
            <p>T'Challa and unveiled the existence of the Black Panther to the intelligence world when he pursued the wrongly convicted Winter Soldier who had been framed for the attack before he ended up apprehending Helmut Zemo and bring him to justice.</p>
            <p>After this, T'Challa returned to Wakanda to be coronated after a ceremonial rite of passage that is undertaken by all Black Panthers. His new reign was however not smooth as his throne was challenged by a long-lost cousin Eric Killmonger who managed to usurp the throne. This interlude to T'Challaâ€™s reign was however short as he was able to take back his throne from his cousin.</p>
            <p>T'Challa was present at the battle of Wakanda where the Avengers made their last stand when the armies of Thanos arrived on earth. Though T'Challa fought valiantly, he was unfortunately dusted along with half of the population on earth when Thanos won.</p>
            <p>T'Challa was however able to come back and aid the Avengers in the second fight against the armies of Thanos when everyone who was dusted came back to life</p>
